A blockchain is just a chain/list of blocks. Each block in the blockchain will have its own digital fingerprint, contain digital fingerprint of the previous block, and have some data ( this data could be transactions for example ).

### Hash = digital footprint

Sha-256 : takes a input string and converts to a fixed sixze unique fingerprint (hash), returns hex string, is case sensitive


StringBuffer : used when building string in loops, since it is mutable. and avoids ccreeating temporary objects
