# Simple Blockchain

##### Tldr : a very own cryptocurrency 

A blockchain implementation in Java featuring:

- **Block-based data storage**  
- **SHA-256 cryptographic chaining**  
- **Proof-of-Work mining**  
- **Data integrity validation**  
- **Wallet creation with Elliptic Curve cryptography**  
- **Public and private key generation for wallets**  
- **Digital signature algorithm to secure fund transfers**  
- **User-friendly transaction mechanism with**

## Dependencies

This project requires the BouncyCastle cryptographic library and GSON for JSON serialization.

- [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) — for cryptographic functions  
- [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) — for JSON handling

## Features Overview

- Create wallets easily using   
- Each wallet generates its own ECC public/private key pair  
- Secure fund transfers with digital signatures to prove ownership  
- Add transactions to blocks using simple method calls
